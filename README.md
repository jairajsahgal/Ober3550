# Oliver Mainey's Computer Science Portfolio 
(Updated 23rd November 2020)  

## Introduction  
I'm Oliver Mainey, a recent Bachelor of Information Technology Graduate from the Queensland University of Technology. I majored in Computer Science and Simulation Science because I have a strong passion for high performance, mathematically based systems. My Inspirations are Jonathan Blow, Andrei Alexandrescu and Mike Acton (aswell as many of the great speakers at CPP Con). These people consistently challenge the fundamental ideas of what it means to focus on performance improving the software industry to atleast try and utilize some of the sheer computation that modern hardware provides (and isn't always used well).  
I am always working on something, whether it be a small, medium, or large sized project. I focus on learning new technologies to increase my expertise, improving my work ethic and flexing my brain with problem solving whenever I can.

## C++ Project Template
When I first started learning C++ it was just so difficult. Too many things to know, too many conflicting sources and lastly too many documents without a working demo. So that's why I've made my own template that people are free to use. It's lightweight, has great libraries installed and a small amount of code for the stuff that I know I struggled with so you don't have to.

## Factorio Mods (Lua)
Creating many multi-faceted modules that interact with a potentially infinite number of other modules is a challenge in dependency and future planning.
